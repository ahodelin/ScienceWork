\subsection*{Baseline data}
In our research, we found six SBML-Bachmann models, one of them as support information of Bachmann \textit{et. al.} \cite{bachmannmodel}, this was the first delivered model. The others come from two different repositories, \hyperlink{https://www.systemsmedicine.net/posts/jws-online-biological-systems-modelling}{JWS Online} and \hyperlink{https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/}{BioModels}.

We found three models on the repository of BioModels. The first, \textsf{BIOMD0000000347\_url.xml}, was submitted on 22nd July 2011 and modified on 31st January 2012. Together with this model were other files in different formats. Most of them were generated by tools to simulate, visualize, validate and document the model, one of them is another SBML model, \textsf{BIOMD0000000347\_urn.xml}. The third and newest, Bachmann2011.xml, was posted on 14th November 2019. This one hat other complementary files for the simulation of this model. The models in JWS Online do not have any date of building or update, so we do not know when these were built. The first model in JWS online, bachmann.xml, is from \textit{Mus musculus} and represents the STAT's pathway in a cell simulation \textit{in silico}. The second model, \textsf{bachmann2.xml}, was obtained from the BioModels database (BioModels ID: BIOMD0000000347).
