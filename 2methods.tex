\section*{Materials and methods}
To provide the Bachmann model \cite{bachmannmodel} as a Fully Featured COMBINE Archive, we have created a public repository using the open-source platform GitHub, with a CC0-1.0 License. This repository contains the proposal directory's structure of the paper Scharm \& Waltemath \cite{combine} with the directories documentation, model, experiment, and result. We chose this open-source platform because it has some features for documentation, data management, and agile project management \cite{github}.

The work on this project was divided into four groups. The tasks of each of them were reviewing existing materials, creating documentation templates, comparison of provided models, provision of detailed metadata, graphical representation, and supplying of model-script.
