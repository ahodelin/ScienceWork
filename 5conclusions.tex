\section*{Conclusions}
It is of evident importance for systems and synthetic biology to create reproducible models. In this case study, we reproduced large parts of a dynamic pathway model of \ac{jak}/\ac{stat}5 signaling \cite{bachmannmodel} by creating fully-featured \ac{combine} archive. This study was performed in an agile working environment and made available on \hyperlink{https://github.com/ahodelin/Bachmann_Archive}{GitHub}, ensuring a fully publicly traceable documentation of the work process. The provided \ac{combine} archive might serve as example for future efforts to increase reproducibility of studies in systems, medical and synthetic biology, and educational purposes. However, we were not able to reproduce all results of the investigated model, mostly due to the limited project time and the lack of parameters in the model description. Therefore, further communication with the authors will likely be needed.
