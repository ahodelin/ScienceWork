\section*{Discussion} 
This is the discussion section.

"The purpose of discussion is that the study should be subjected to a critical analysis of the study results
by the authors themselves. Any lessons learned - both with respect to study questions and the
methodology - should be reported for others to learn from.
A structured discussion as proposed below is often not required by the journal but it will ease the
writing as well as the reading."
