\subsection*{Scientific background}
The increase of size and complexity of simulation studies in systems biology and systems medicine proposes new challenges to sharing reproducible results. The \ac{combine} improves the coordination of standard formats for several features of simulation studies, such as \ac{sbml}, CellML, \ac{sbgn}, and \ac{sbrml}. These standards aim to encode, simulate and visualize biological models \cite{combine}.

On the other side, GitHub has been used as an essential common platform for managing software projects and supporting collaborative development. Now a day some educational projects have begun to adopt it for hosting and managing course content because it gets transparency features to create, reuse, and remix materials; and to monitor activity on assignments and projects \cite{github}.

The purpose of this study is to provide...
